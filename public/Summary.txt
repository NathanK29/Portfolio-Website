Hi my name is Nathan! I am from Tucson, Arizona and am currently pursuing my 
Bachelors of Science in Computer Science at the University of Arizona, I am
expected to graduate in Spring of 2026. I have always been interested in computers
and coding since I was young and thats why I decided to pursue a career in 
Software Engineering. I look forward to gaining more experience and exploring
new technologies.
